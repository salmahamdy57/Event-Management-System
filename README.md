Repository for the **Event Management System**, focusing exclusively on **testing and validation**, providing API specifications, Postman collections, and comprehensive Mocha/Selenium E2E tests to verify functionality, security, and UI workflows for a full-stack web application that enables creating, managing, and RSVPing to events with JWT-based authentication and role-based access control.
